## 🌌 Vision: The Era of Ownerless Infrastructure

The NNG Protocol is not just a token; it is an experiment in **Absolute Autonomy**. In a world trending towards centralized control, $NNG represents a pivot back to the core ethos of decentralized finance—immutable, ownerless, and sovereign.

We have engineered $NNG to be a digital commodity that operates without human intervention. By utilizing the Solana Token-2022 (Token Extensions) standard, we've inscribed the economic laws directly into the blockchain.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

$NNG is built on the cutting edge of the Solana ecosystem, leveraging advanced extensions to define its behavior.

| Parameter | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Token Name** | nayrbryanGaming |
| **Symbol** | $NNG |
| **Supply Cap** | 1,000,000,000 (1 Billion) |
| **Decimals** | 9 |
| **Program ID** | `TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkThT9PzZBm9GGr359Cr9` |

### Core Protocol Extensions

1.  **Sovereign Mode (Satoshi 2.0)**: All administrative authorities—Mint, Freeze, and Account Management—have been permanently revoked. No entity, including the creator, can ever inflate the supply, freeze user accounts, or modify the protocol's core parameters. $NNG is effectively a public digital good.
2.  **Transfer Fee Dynamics**: A native **0.1% (10 bps)** fee is applied to every transaction. This fee is managed purely by the protocol, intended for autonomous distribution or burn mechanisms depending on future network integrations.
3.  **On-Chain Metadata**: Protocol identity is inscribed directly into the Mint account via the Metadata Pointer extension, ensuring perpetual verifiability without reliance on centralized storage.

## 💎 The Economic Constitution

- **Immutable Supply**: The 1 Billion hard cap is final.
- **Zero Centralization**: No update authority exists.
- **Protocol Enforced Fees**: Transaction gravity is maintainable and predictable.

## 🚀 Deployment Status

The protocol is live and verified on the Solana Devnet. The transition to absolute autonomy has been executed.

## ⚖️ License

The NNG Protocol is released under the **MIT License**. It is a sovereign digital commodity for the global gaming and utility ecosystem.
