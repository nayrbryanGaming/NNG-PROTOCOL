# $NNG - The Quantum-Resistant Sovereign Protocol (Satoshi 2.0 Edition)

## 1. Executive Summary
$NNG (nayrbryanGaming) is a decentralized utility protocol built on the Solana blockchain using the advanced Token-2022 (Token Extensions) standard. Designed with a 2050 horizon, $NNG is engineered to remain functional and secure in a post-quantum computing era where traditional encryption and legacy financial systems fail. By removing human intervention, $NNG operates as a truly autonomous digital commodity.

## 2. Technical Architecture
- **Protocol Standard:** Solana Token-2022 Extension.
- **Quantum Defenses:** Integration of Confidential Transfers using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs to ensure transaction metadata remains shielded against future decryption technologies.
- **Autonomous Enforcement:** The protocol’s "Mint Authority" and "Freeze Authority" have been permanently revoked (set to null), ensuring no entity can ever inflate the supply or censor user accounts.

## 3. The Economic Engine (Tokenomics)
- **Ticker:** $NNG
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 (Fixed/Hard Cap).
- **Hyper-Efficient Fee Structure:** A total transfer fee of 0.1%—engineered to be the lowest globally.
- **0.05% Auto-Burn:** Systematic deflation to increase scarcity over decades.
- **0.05% Ecosystem Treasury:** Autonomous fund for infrastructure maintenance and the "NNG" ecosystem (Cinema, Property, Bot).
- **Developer Allocation:** 5% (50,000,000 $NNG) held in the Sovereign Dev Wallet: `35z7X59rtyts557Up1RAwpyYN7x2cFqcDc7RjPuNxFzr`.

## 4. Roadmap to 2050
$NNG is built to transition seamlessly as global governments move on-chain. The protocol’s immutable logic ensures that while regulations change, your sovereignty within the $NNG ecosystem remains absolute.
